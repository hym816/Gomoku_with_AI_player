# Gomoku_with_AI_player
A simple game with a graphical interface for Gomoku (Five in a Row) human-computer battle based on a lightweight decision tree.

# What to do next?
In the player-versus-player section, currently, it only supports two people taking turns to click the mouse on the same machine. Playing over a network on two separate devices might be a better solution. I have only set up the basic network framework, but it hasn't been implemented yet.
